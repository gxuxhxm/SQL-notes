   About this dataset

To practice logical operators in SQL, you'll be using data from [Billboard Music Charts](http://www.billboard.com/charts). It was collected in January 2014 and contains data from 1956 through 2013. The results in this table are the _year-end_ results—the top 100 songs at the end of each year.

To access the dataset, use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
```

- `year_rank` is the rank of that song at the end of the listed year.
- `group_name` is the name of the entire group that won (this could be multiple artists if there was a collaboration).
- `artist` is an individual artist. This is a little complicated, as an artist can be an individual or group.
