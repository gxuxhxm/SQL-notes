## Why should you limit your results?

Many analysts use limits as a simple way to keep their queries from taking too long to return. The aim of many of your queries will simply be to see what a particular table looks likeâ€”you'll want to scan the first few rows of data to get an idea of which fields you care about and how you want to manipulate them. If you query a very large table (such as one with hundreds of thousands or millions of rows) and don't use a limit, you could end up waiting a long time for all of your results to be displayed, which doesn't make sense if you only care about the first few.

## Using the SQL `LIMIT` command

The limiting functionality is built into Mode to prevent you from accidentally returning millions of rows without meaning to (we've all done it). However, if you're ever using SQL outside of Mode, you can manually add a limit with a SQL command. The following syntax does the same thing as having the box checked with a value of 100:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
 LIMIT 100
```
